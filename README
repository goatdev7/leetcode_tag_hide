# Toggle Difficulty Tag

I built this toggle tool that hides a problem’s difficulty during solving, so I can approach it without bias and reveal its true challenge only after completing it. It is a simple Chrome extension that hides the difficulty tag on problem pages and lets you toggle it on or off by clicking the extension icon.

## How It Works
- The extension uses a content script with a MutationObserver to watch for elements matching certain classes and hides them.
- When you click the extension icon, it toggles between hiding and showing these elements.

## Installation

- Clone or download this repo.
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable Developer Mode.
- Click "Load unpacked" and select this extension’s folder.

## Notes
The extension only works on pages where content scripts are allowed.
